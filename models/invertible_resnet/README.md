## Invertible Residual Networks

Official Pytorch implementation of i-ResNets.

i-ResNets define a family of fully invertible deep networks, built by constraining the Lipschitz constant of standard residual network blocks.

## i-ResNet Usage

Tested with: Python 3.6.5 and Pytorch 1.0.1

Dependencies can be installed via `pip install -r requirements.txt`

Note: You need to run visdom server and set vis_server location as well as port.

Train i-ResNet classifier on CIFAR10:
```
$ bash scripts/classify_cifar.sh
```
Train i-ResNet density model on CIFAR10 (Batch size and learning rate optimized for 4GPUs):
```
$ bash scripts/dens_est_cifar.sh
```

  abstract = 	 {We show that standard ResNet architectures can be made invertible, allowing the same model to be used for classification, density estimation, and generation. Typically, enforcing invertibility requires partitioning dimensions or restricting network architectures. In contrast, our approach only requires adding a simple normalization step during training, already available in standard frameworks. Invertible ResNets define a generative model which can be trained by maximum likelihood on unlabeled data. To compute likelihoods, we introduce a tractable approximation to the Jacobian log-determinant of a residual block. Our empirical evaluation shows that invertible ResNets perform competitively with both state-of-the-art image classifiers and flow-based generative models, something that has not been previously achieved with a single architecture.}
